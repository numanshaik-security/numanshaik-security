# Hey, I’m Numan 👋

I’m a final-semester Cybersecurity M.S. student based in Houston, working toward a career as a SOC Analyst or Detection Engineer.  
I enjoy building **small, focused labs** that answer practical questions like *“who scanned me?”* and *“what did they try?”*  

---

### 🔧 What I’m working on
- **Windows Security Monitoring (Splunk)** – tracking failed logons (4625), account lockouts, and brute-force attempts  
- **Snort → Splunk Portscan** – detecting Nmap SYN bursts and visualizing top sources/ports with timelines  
- **OWASP ZAP – Juice Shop Assessment** – web application vulnerability scanning and reporting  

---

### 🎯 Why I build these labs
I learn best by simulating real-world scenarios, collecting raw logs, and transforming them into **fields, searches, and dashboards** that speed up investigation and triage.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- SIEM: Splunk (SPL queries, dashboards)  
- Threat Detection: Windows Event Logs, Snort, OWASP ZAP  
- Networking & Testing: Nmap, Wireshark basics  
- Platforms: VirtualBox, Docker, Ubuntu, Kali Linux  
- Scripting: Basic Python  
- **Certification**: CompTIA Security+
