# Hey, I’m Numan 👋

Final-semester Cybersecurity M.S. student in Houston. I’m aiming for a SOC Analyst / Detection Engineer role and I like building **small, useful labs** that answer real questions like “who scanned me?” and “what did they try?”

### What I’m working on
- **Windows Security Monitoring (Splunk)** – failed logons (4625), lockouts, trends, and brute-force logic  
- **Snort → Splunk Portscan** – detect Nmap SYN bursts and visualize top sources/ports + timeline

### Why I built these
I learn best by instrumenting a tiny network and turning raw logs into **fields, searches, and visuals** that speed up triage.

### Skills & tools
Splunk (SPL), Windows Event Logs, Snort, Nmap, basic Python, VirtualBox  
**Cert:** CompTIA Security+

### Projects
- **Windows Security Monitoring (Splunk SIEM)**  
  Repo: `numanshaik-security/Splunk-security-dashboard`  
  Focus: 4625/4624/4740, trends, last-50 table, brute-force logic
- **Snort → Splunk Portscan Demo**  
  Repo: `numanshaik-security/snort-splunk-portscan-demo`  
  Focus: SYN-burst alerts, field parsing, top sources/ports, timechart

### What’s next
- Add Sysmon panels for process/network visibility  
- Slow-scan detection and enrichment (GeoIP, internal/external tags)
